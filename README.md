# CityLAB Plotter

Controlling a plotter [conucon 3DTwin XYZ](https://www.conucon.de/openbuilds/3dtwin-xyz-linearfuehrung-500x500m-mit-usb-cnc-schrittmotor-steuerung-und-software_2000006_1076) with Node over Serialport.  

## Frontend

The frontend is currently a rough Typescript application using redux to handle state. Bundled with parcel. Dev version runs on [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234).


```bash
cd frontend
mv .env.example .env
# adjust API_PORT if needed
npm ci
npm run dev
```

## Backend

A Typescript REST Express API to handle connections over serial port to the plotter MCU.  Dev version runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

```bash
cd backend
mv .env.example .env
# adjust SERIAL_PORT if needed
npm ci
npm run dev
```

## Firmware

Currently the firmware is only for dev purpose. Build with platformio on Arduino Mega 2560. It echos what you send over serial.
